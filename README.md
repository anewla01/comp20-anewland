1. What is the purpse of this Git repository ?
	I Git repository provides version control to users. This is something that 
	is invaluable when creating large programs or working in groups. 
	Ultimately it provides user with a sense of security as when putting their
	programs under vast amount of construction.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why ?
	My favorite assignment was assignment 2 (Mauraders Map). This was the first 
	time I had actually launhed a web application on my own (for the most part 
	given the wide number of reosurces given to the class). It was an exciting 
	experience. While I had meddled around with web application in the past, 
	jumping into a project with a previously unused api provided an 
	exhilirating challenge. 

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now ?
	From day 1 until now I have grown a lot. This cours has forced me to 
	improve my ability to trouble shoot program issues as well as reasearch 
	methods to solve problems.  I've also taken a few lessons in time
	managagement which has come from a combination of taking this course 
	and 4 others (one of which includes comp 40). At the begining of this course
	I wasn't aware of just how complex web dev could become, and while there
	are very simple parts there are a lot of places where things get very hairy.
	At any rate my introduction to this world via this class has given me
	the opportunity to persue future skills in this area.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course ? Cite two 
examples as evidence.
	One of the most important lessons I gained from this course was the 
	usefulness of api's. While I always understood the idea of not reinventing
	the wheel I never understood just how much was at my fingertips. For 
	instance building a web application such as Maurader's Map from scratch 
	would have been incredibly difficult if it were not for the google maps api.
	The simple fact is one that I while take with me into the summer as I look
	for a side project. I intend to browse the various apis on the web to see
	what is already at my disposal and build from there. It also became 
	extremely apparent how it important it is to research the quirks of a 
	programming langauge before undergoing the process of writing code for with 
	that langauge. I learned very quickly that javascript does not act in the
	way you expect. A perfect example are the various instance of comparisons 
	with equal signs that can occur, and the fact that there is a 21 by 21 
	chart displaying when things are actualy considered equivalent.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve 
deeper into?
	With the course coming to a close it's safe to say that I have gotten a 
	taste, albeit small taste, of the world of web dev. I'm extremely 
	interested in security and I do hope to get a better understanding of what
	it truly means to protect oneself on the web. Our brief dive into mongodb 
	also revamped my interest in databases. In the future I hope to take a 
	course on data mining to better understand what the field is about. As well
	as computer systems secutiry to better understand what it means to be
	protected. While I was crushed by the assignment involving making a server
	I am deeply curious about how to set server's up and will more than likely
	do more research in this vein.
